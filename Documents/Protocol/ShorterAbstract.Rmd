**Background**:
Although recent clinical practice guidelines suggest initiating therapy with two drugs, more than 50% of people currently treated for hypertension start with a single medication.
For these patients, clinical guidelines propose adding a second antihypertensive drug for treatment escalation.
However, the guidelines provide little guidance on which specific agents to add for which patients. There are no large randomized controlled trials (RCT) to guide recommendations about the choice of the second drug.

**Methods and Analysis**:
The Large-Scale Evidence Generations Across a Network of Databases for Hypertension Stepped Care Treatment (LEGEND-HtnStepCare) initiative is a series of systematic, large-scale, multinational, real-world comparative cardiovascular effectiveness and safety studies of all combination of second-line antihypertensive agents.
LEGEND-HtnStepCare will leverage the Observational Health Data Science and Informatics (OHDSI) community that provides access to a global network of electronic health record (EHR) data sources.
LEGEND-HtnStepCare will identify all adult, HTN patients who newly initiate a traditionally second-line antihypertensive agent, including individuals with and without established cardiovascular disease.
Using an active comparator, new-user cohort design, LEGEND-HtnStepCare will execute all pairwise class-vs-class and drug-vs-drug comparisons in each data source that meet a minimum patient count of 1,000 per arm and extensive study diagnostics that assess reliability and generalizability through cohort balance and equipoise to examine the relative risk of cardiovascular and safety outcomes.
The primary cardiovascular outcomes include a 3-point and a 4-point composite of major adverse cardiovascular events, and series of safety outcomes.
The study will pursue data-driven, large-scale propensity adjustment for measured confounding, a large set of negative control outcome experiments to address unmeasured and systematic bias.

**Ethics and Dissemination**:
The study ensures data safety through a federated analytic approach and follows research best practices, including prespecification and full disclosure of hypotheses tested and their results.
LEGEND-HtnStepCare is dedicated to open science and transparency and will publicly share all our analytic code from reproducible cohort definitions through turn-key software, enabling other research groups to leverage our methods, data, and results in order to verify and extend our findings.
